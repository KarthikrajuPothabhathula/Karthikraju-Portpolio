            <p class="clean">After graduating, I worked at Royal Sundaram General Insurance as a Claims Assessment Trainee for a year. 
                I reviewed and processed insurance claims, making sure they were accurate and valid.
                 This job helped me develop strong analytical skills and attention to detail.
                Next, I worked for two years at Natco Pharma Limited as a Maintenance Engineer. 
                I was responsible for maintaining and ensuring the smooth operation of various equipment.
                 This role required strong problem-solving skills and the ability to keep machines in good working condition.
                I became interested in how apps and websites are created, which led me to switch careers to become a UI/UX designer and developer.
                 In this role, I designed and developed user interfaces and experiences for digital products. I worked on many projects, and you can see my work on my Behance portfolio and GitHub. 
                 These projects show my skills in design and development and my passion for technology.</p>
